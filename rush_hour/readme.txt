RUSH HOUR SOLVER
Simple Java Implementation

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_Hour_(board_game)

Description

The board is a 6x6 grid with grooves in the tiles to allow cars to slide, and an exit hole which according to the puzzle cards, only the red car can escape. The game comes with 12 cars and 4 trucks, each colored differently. The cars take up 2 squares each; and the trucks take up 3.
Each puzzle card shows which colored cars get placed on the board and also where they should be placed.
Each card has a different level number. The higher the level number, the more difficult the puzzle.
Cars and trucks can only be moved within a straight line along the grid. They cannot be rotated.

Objective

The goal of the game is to get the red car out of a six-by-six grid full of automobiles by moving the other vehicles out of its way. However, the cars and trucks (set up before play according to a puzzle card) obstruct the path which makes the puzzle harder.
